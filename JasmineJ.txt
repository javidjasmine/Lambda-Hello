Hello Lambda!
My name is Jasmine Javid.
Three words that describe me: 
patient, introverted, empath.

I actually have a fairly new pastime and that is riding ATVs/four-wheelers.
It's thrilling. It gets me out of my shell and allows me to let my inner tomboy child free!

*********************** The Opposite of Me ******************************************************
I am selfish, cruel, and unforgiving.

I don't enjoy much of anything. If I had to declare a pastime it would be playing chess.
I enjoy the calculation and domination required for the game.
